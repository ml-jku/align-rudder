 In order to cluster states, a similarity measure between them is required. We suggest to use the “successor representation” [Dayan, 1993](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/papers/d93b.pdf) of the states, which gives a similarity matrix based on how connected two states are given a policy. For computing the successor representation, we use the demonstrations combined with state-action sequences generated by a random policy. For high dimensional state spaces “successor features” [Barreto et al., 2017](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6994-successor-features-for-transfer-in-reinforcement-learning.pdf) can be used.
